## Technologies Used

This game is powered by the magic of JavaScript! With its spellbinding capabilities, I've woven together a seamless gaming experience. From DOM manipulation to event handling, JavaScript has been my trusty sidekick throughout this journey.

## JavaScript Sorcery

- **DOM Manipulation**: Crafted the game interface with finesse.
- **Event Listeners**: Captured user clicks and tracked their progress.
- **Array Magic**: Stored and compared sequences of colors like a pro.
- **Conditional Enchantments**: Kept Simon on his toes with clever logic.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Simon for being the ultimate inspiration. And to JavaScript, for being both the hero and the villain of this tale. Also, to the coffee machine for keeping me fueled during those late-night coding sessions.
